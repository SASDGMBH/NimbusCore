# NimbusCore

**NimbusCore** is the foundation of the **NimbusStack** ecosystem, designed to provide a robust and scalable cloud framework for modern JavaScript applications. It offers essential services such as **service discovery**, **configuration management**, **circuit breakers**, and **distributed logging** to enhance resilience in cloud-native environments.

## Why NimbusCore?

In today's microservices-driven world, applications require efficient orchestration and communication between distributed components. **NimbusCore** addresses these challenges by providing a set of core functionalities that enable:

- **Service Discovery & Registration**: Ensures seamless interaction between microservices without hardcoded dependencies.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized and dynamic configuration handling for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Circuit Breakers & Fault Tolerance**: Prevents cascading failures by monitoring service health and managing failures proactively.
- **Distributed Logging & Monitoring**: Collects and organizes logs from multiple services for better observability.
- **API Gateway Support**: Facilitates efficient request routing, security, and traffic management.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic efficiently to maintain system performance and stability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Enables asynchronous communication between services for enhanced responsiveness and scalability.

## Use Cases

- **Cloud-Native Applications**: Designed for microservices architectures that need service discovery and configuration management.
- **Scalable APIs**: Supports API gateways and load balancing for high-traffic applications.
- **Resilient Distributed Systems**: Provides circuit breaker mechanisms and logging to enhance fault tolerance.
- **Event-Driven Workflows**: Enables real-time messaging and interactions between services.

## Getting Started

NimbusCore is currently in development. A **Developer Guide** and API documentation will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates!
